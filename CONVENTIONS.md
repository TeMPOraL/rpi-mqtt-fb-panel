Project conventions
- Avoid build steps; keep the Python part installable with simple command and runnable via direct invocation of the main file
- Keep code modular
- Project is targetting a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B V1.1 with a TFT display hooked into it; keep in mind the performance and environment constraints.
