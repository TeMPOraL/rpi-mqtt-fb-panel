# Tracking AI coding costs, for curiosity

- Session 1 - gemini/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06 - $2.53
- Session 2 - Architect: o3 (high) + editor gpt-4.1 - $2.28
  Short responses, looks okay-ish, but burned in ~4 commits through the same amount of money that took gemini-2.5-pro-preview some 64 commits.
  That's a factor 16x of a difference.
- Session 3 - gemini/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06 - $0.28
- Session 4 - gemini/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06 - $1.43
- Session 4 - o3 (high), then Architect: o3 (high) + editor gpt-4.1 - $2.32
  That was a short but expensive optimization session.
- Session 5 - o3 (high), then Architect: o3 (high) + editor gpt-4.1 - $0.53
  This is how much it took to add screenshot capability. Did it in one shot, tho.
Total cost:
USD: (+ 2.53 2.28 0.28 1.43 2.32 0.53)

== $9.37
